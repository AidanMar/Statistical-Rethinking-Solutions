# Statistical-Rethinking-Solutions
The Systems and Signals group at Imperial College London is doing a reading group based on Richard McElreath's book, Statistical Rethinking. The book is a great primer to bayesian inference and performing data analysis in code.

Here I present some a set of solutions to the end of chapter problems. The solutions are implemented in python, primarily making use of PyMC3, a probabilistic programming language, well suited for doing bayesian analysis in a straightforward manner.
